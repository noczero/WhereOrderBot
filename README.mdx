WhereOrderBot
====
Simple bot assistant that can answer "Where is my order?".

## Context
Implement a bot assistant that will provide some answers based on the question prompts.
Additionally, you would like to assess whether the question can be answered automatically by a computer or if a human should respond.

The bot has some constraints and limitations to make it simple.
1. The bot can't have the memory of the conversation. It means it gives just a single answer for single questions and single-order items.
2. The bot will give a response for where_is_my_order only category or intent, beside that it won't. It requires building an Intent Classification model.
3. Assume the bot can connect to an internal API that provides order information with http://localhost/orders/{order_id} and the user can click the link to proceed and it has a user cookie or token to validate the user. the bot's message response will be concatenated with the link.
4. If there's no order id in the prompts, it will use the latest user's order id otherwise it will extract the order_id using the NER model.
5. To assess whether the question will be answered by a human or the bot by using the Sentiment-Analysis model, if the user question is unhappy or mad, or unpleasant it requires the human to answer it.
6. The bot response template may vary with order response whether it is late or on schedule.

Example bot conversation will have:
```
